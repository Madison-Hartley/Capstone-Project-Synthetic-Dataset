# Capstone-Project-Synthetic-Dataset
Engineering capstone project completed over the 2022-2023 school year in the ENG 4000 course, ran by Lassonde School of Engineering at York University.
We created a synthetic dataset to train an object detection model to detect humans reliably, accurately, and cheaply. We applied it to a security system, and achieved fantastic results.
